          <p>Thank you for your continuing support of Ann Arbor Academic Games. Because of the support of parents, school administrators, and coaches, we have been able to serve as an enrichment activity for over 200 Ann Arbor students every year.</p>
          <p>As an organization we are faced with numerous expenses each year. We have to provide the materials for our growing teams. We have to cover the tournament costs for our volunteers. Most importantly, we have to make sure through scholarships that all students are able to participate regardless of their familyâ€™s financial ability.</p>
          <p>Our goals as an organization are to encourage learning and achievement and to facilitate the friendships and camaraderie students build as part of a team. We hope that the AG season, culminating in the state and national tournaments, will continue to provide meaningful experiences for its participants as it has for students and coaches over the past 50 years.</p>
